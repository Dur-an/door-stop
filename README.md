HECK YEAH => This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# HOLLA HOLLA GET DOLLA
This project is (at the time of this writing) just starting. We have
a couple prototypes: https://github.com/jameydev/door-stop-node-version 
by @jameydev
and the OG thing: https://github.com/LARRYKlNG/money
by The Wonderful WIZard of Code!

This website is a DuoDev project. DuoDev is one of Jamey's favorite
team programming styles (Note: I will make a DuoDev organization soon for all these two-man projects).

This version uses Next.js. We decided we needed React and Node, but we also need 
TypeScript and an easy way to combine everything.

The debug-developer-not-even-alpha stable version is currently hosted at: 
https://doorstop956.glitch.me/

## Getting Started
# UH, ACTUALLY!
1. 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jameydev/door-stop-next

git fetch # to sync any changes from remote, good practice every so often imho

npm install # to install all dependencies
```
# NOW...
### *You may get started!*


First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

# All the below is a bunch of generated links n stuff to the Next.js docs
### *You do read the documentation don't you?*



You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
